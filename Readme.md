Note: I scanned all branches but only found a short top-level Readme. Descriptions above were generated from branch names; if you want full README texts from each branch included verbatim, grant access or confirm and I will open a PR to fetch each branch README and merge their detailed descriptions.

(If you want changes, tell me whether to add links to branch commits or include specific README excerpts.)
